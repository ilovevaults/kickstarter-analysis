# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Using a dataset of various types of campaigns, goals, media categories, and different countries to look for trends.
### Purpose
Analyzing different types of campaigns and how they compared to their launch dates and funding goals
## Analysis and Challenges
In most cases the campaigns were successful in every category and subcategory.One challenged I faced was creating the pivot table to match what was in the module challenge and being about to create a similar graph. Another challenge was trying to figure the functions to use to get the date in the proper format.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
It looks like the number of campaigns in the theater that were successful was greater than the number of campaigns that failed in every month except for December. There was also an increase of successful campaigns during March till May and then there is a huge decline till September. The number of failed campaigns decreased from January till Feburary then it was pretty much constant for the rest of the months. The number of canceled campaigns was pretty constant too during the whole time.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Both the percentages of successful and failed campaigns flucuated throughout the whole graph while the percentage of canceled campaigns stayed zero during the whole time.But overall the percentages of the successful campaigns were higher more often than the percentages of the failed campaigns.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Successful campaigns made up most of the total number of outcomes while canceled campaigns made up the least. The failed campaigns seems to be the most consistent out of all of them.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
In most of the goal ranges the number of successful campaigns are higher than the number of failed campaigns. The number of canceled campaigns were zero for all of the goal ranges
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
One of the limitations of this dataset is that some of the campaigns are located in different countries with different time zones. Having different time zones can restrict the audience size on any given time. If we only used campaigns that were in the US the dataset won't be as limited because the time difference would not be as great. 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
